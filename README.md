# CIFAR-10ClassificationProject
Image classification is a fascinating deep learning project. Specifically, image classification comes under the computer vision project category.  In this project, I built a convolution neural network on a CIFAR-10 dataset. First, I did some exploration in our dataset, and then trained my neural network using python and keras.
