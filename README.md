# CIFAR-10ClassificationProject

Image classification is a fascinating deep learning project. 

In this project, I built a convolution neural network on a CIFAR-10 dataset. 

First, I did some exploration in our dataset, and then trained my neural network using python and keras.

### Important Dependencies

tkinter is required for GUI creation and launching the application:-

#### !conda install -c anaconda tk
